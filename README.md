# Propnight game Bind for A-D keys
Auto-clicker for the Propnight game.

This program is an auto-clicker for the game "Propnight".
When you press the binded key, the program will start clicking "A" and "D" keys once in 20 milliseconds. This can help you to set free from "killer"'s hands.

I used "Hook Manager" library to detect keys pressing while program is minimized.

**Instructions:**
1. To change the bind key you can double click on textfield and press a new key.
2. To change the interval between clicks you can change this interval inside the Interval textfield and press "Save".
